  Rails API testing best practises. Guidelines for testing an API using RSpec,
  what we should be testing for and setting correct expectations.

Writing an API is almost a given with modern web applications. I'd like to lay
out some simple guidelines and best practises for Rails API testing. We need to
determine what to test and why it should be tested. Once we've established what
we will be writing tests for, we will set up RSpec to do this quickly and
easily. Basically we'll be sending HTTP requests and testing that the response
status codes and content match our expectations.

## What to test?

A properly designed API should return two things: an HTTP response status-code
and the response body. Testing the status-code is necessary for web applications
with user authentication and resources with different permissions. That being
said, testing the response body should just verify that the application is
sending the right content.

### HTTP Status Codes

Typical HTTP responses for a simple API on an application with authentication
will generally fall within the following 4 status codes:

- **200: OK** - Basically self-explanitory, the request went okay.
- **401: Unauthorized** - Authentication credentials were invalid.
- **403: Forbidden** - The resource requested is not accessible - in a Rails
  app, this would generally be based on permissions.
- **404: Not Found** - The resource doesn't exist on the server.

If you're wondering why not just use 401 - Unauthorized or 403 - Forbidden for
every permission/auth error, I'd suggest reading
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6937030/492566">this stackoverflow
answer</a>. If that's not enough, check out the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html">W3 spec</a>.

### Response Body

It goes without saying that the content body should contain the resources that
you requested and shouldn't contain attributes that are private. This is
straight forward for `GET` requests, but what if you're sending a `POST` or
`DELETE` request? Your test should also ensure that any desired business logic
gets completed as expected.

## API Testing is Integration Testing

Just like we use an integration tests to ensure that our app behaves as planned,
we also require that our API responds as desired. These tests are based on HTTP
requests to urls with calculated responses. For user interaction, Capybara is my
testing tool of choice, but it is the wrong tool for testing APIs. Jonas Nicklas
(creator of Capybara) wrote
<a href="http://www.elabs.se/blog/34-capybara-and-testing-apis">Capybara and
Testing APIs</a> to explain why you shouldn't use it.

  "Do not test APIs with Capybara. It wasnâ€™t designed for it." - Jonas Nicklas
</blockquote>

Instead, use Rack::Test, rather than the Capybara internals.

### Use RSpec Request Specs

Since we've established that we'll be using Rack::Test to drive the tests, RSpec
request specs make the most sense. There's no need to get fancy and add extra
weight to your testing tools for this.

To test requests and their responses, just add a new request spec. I'll
demonstrate testing a user sessions endpoint. My API returns a token on a
successful login.

```ruby
# spec/requests/api/v1/messages_spec.rb
describe "Messages API" do
  it 'sends a list of messages' do
    FactoryGirl.create_list(:message, 10)

    get '/api/v1/messages'

    json = JSON.parse(response.body)

    # test for the 200 status-code
    expect(response).to be_success

    # check to make sure the right amount of messages are returned
    expect(json['messages'].length).to eq(10)
  end
end
```

This works exceptionally well for get, post and delete requests. Just check for
the status code you want, and that the response body is as you expected. That
being said, with this setup we'll be doing `json = JSON.parse(response.body)` a
lot. This should be a helper method.

### Add the `json` Helper

To DRY things out for future tests, pull the json parsing logic into an RSpec
helper. This is what I've done:

```ruby
# spec/support/request_helpers.rb
module Requests
  module JsonHelpers
    def json
      JSON.parse(response.body)
    end
  end
end
```

And then add the following line inside the config block of `spec_helper.rb`

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # ... The rest of your RSpec config.

  config.include Requests::JsonHelpers, type: :request
end
```

Now we can remove any of the `JSON.parse(response.body)` calls within our tests.

Let's have another example spec, this time getting a single message.

```ruby
# spec/requests/api/v1/messages_spec.rb
describe "Messages API" do
  it 'retrieves a specific message' do
    message = FactoryGirl.create(:message)
    get "/api/v1/messages/#{message.id}"

    # test for the 200 status-code
    expect(response).to be_success

    # check that the message attributes are the same.
    expect(json['content']).to eq(message.content)

    # ensure that private attributes aren't serialized
    expect(json['private_attr']).to eq(nil)
  end
end
```

Okay - you're done. Keep this in mind when you're building out your api, and
you'll be golden. I promise. If you need some more info on how to set up your
app as an API, I'd highly recommend this article:
