meta_description: Set up webpack to provide hot module replacement for React. Using BabelJS and the react-transform-hmr plugin, enabling HMR is only a few lines of configuration.

Out of the box, webpack supports a fancy new alternative to full page refreshes.
Hot module replacement replaces the live code running on your development
machine. The major benefit of hot module replacement is that state is not lost –
if you've had to click a number of things to get to the point in your app that
you're working on, you won't perform a full page refresh and lose the history of
those actions.

Here it is at work – notice that the timer doesn't reset to 0 as it would after
a page reload.

Increasing the speed of of your feedback loop frees up more time to do
meaningful work, focusing more on building your app, not clicking through a
sequence you've clicked through 50 times already. There's nothing more
frustrating than troubleshooting some UI bug that's at the end of 8 actions.

_Acknowledgments:_

Before we get started, I have to give credit to [Dan Abramov][dan-abramov],
his open source work, and his talk [Live React: Hot Reloading with Time
Travel][time-travel-react] at react-europe.  Without his contributions to the
community, hot module replacement in React would be a lot more difficult.

## Install and Configure Webpack

First, initialize a new project and install `webpack`.

```shell
mkdir react-hmr
cd react-hmr
git init
npm init
npm install -g webpack
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Now, let's get webpack set up. We'll need three parts to make this work, some
JavaScript, an `index.html`, and a webpack configuration to wire everything
together.

The `index.html` will go in the base directory of the project.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>React HMR example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="/static/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Edit `index.js` to run a bit of JavaScript just so we know it's working:

```javascript
document.write("Webpack is doing its thing.");
```

Then add the following webpack configuration to `webpack.config.js`. Webpack
requires an application entry point and an output file for the compiled
JavaScript.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: "./index.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname,
    filename: "bundle.js",
    publicPath: "/static/"
  }
}
```

Now, if you run `webpack` from the project directory, it will compile `index.js`
to `bundle.js`. Great stuff, but it would be even more useful if we had a server
running so that can view our results in the browser.

## Webpack Dev Server

Webpack also has a light weight development server that we'll be using to serve
the assets that it compiles. We'll use this going forward so that we can see the
results of our work in the browser. Install it now:

```shell
npm install webpack-dev-server -g
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

Now we can run `webpack-dev-server` and visit `http://localhost:8080` to view
the results of our work. 👍

This is works, but we want our application to update when we make changes to it.
Right now, if you alter the contents of `index.js`, nothing happens. Instead, we
want webpack to recompile our application, and notify the page to reload. To do
this, run the command with the following flags:

```
webpack-dev-server --progress --inline
```

* `--progress` displays the compilation progress when building
* `--inline` adds webpacks automatic refresh code inline with the compile
  application

### TIP: Reduce global dependencies!
When sharing code with multiple people, it's better to keep things simple. I
recommend adding the following entry to `package.json`
within the `"scripts"` object.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --progress --inline"
  }
}
```

By referencing the webpack dev server directly, rather than with a global
executable it removes a global dependency. Now, when someone clones your
repository, they can run `npm install` and `npm start` to launch the development
server.

From now on, use `npm start` to run the webpack dev server.

## Adding Babel and React

Now we've got a development environment that gives us quick feedback,
so let's add in the interesting stuff: Babel for transpiling JSX and ES2015 (and
beyond!), and React for the UI. Shut down the dev server and install Babel:

```shell
npm install babel-core babel-loader --save-dev
```

Now we need to add this to our webpack build pipeline. Add the following beneath
the `output` object in `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // entry and output options

  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      loaders: ["babel"],
      include: __dirname
    }]
  }
}
```

Loaders are webpack's equivalent to preprocessors. The webpack
[documentation][1] describes them like this:

> Loaders are kind of like “tasks” are in other build tools, and provide a
> powerful way to handle frontend build steps. Loaders can transform files from
> a different language like, CoffeeScript to JavaScript, or inline images as
> data URLs.

To test this out and make sure it's working, restart your dev server with `npm
start` and change `index.js` to include some ES2015 flavoured JavaScript:

```javascript
let docBody = "Webpack is doing its thing, with ES2015!";
document.write(docBody);
```

Webpack will compile this and the browser will update with the string we've
used. Great! Now we can add React into the mix by running:

```
npm install react --save
```

**Note:** Because React is required for our application to run, we're using
 `--save` rather than `--save-dev`.

Now we'll add a simple component and render it to the document body instead of
the string we're currently rendering.

We'll create an `App` component in `components/App.js`:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { counter: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(
      this.increment.bind(this),
      1000
    )
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState(({ counter }) => {
      return {counter: counter + 1};
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval)
  }

  render() {
    const { counter } = this.state;

    return (
      <header>
        <div>Webpack is doing its thing with React and ES2015</div>
        <div>{counter}</div>
      </header>
    );
  }
}
```

Now, change `index.js` to import the component and render it to `document.body`:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import App from './components/App';

React.render(
  <App/>,
  document.body
);
```

Now our component initializes a counter which increments a number every second.
It's not a very interesting component, but for our purposes it's a good
demonstration of how state is lost when the browser reloads a page.
By default webpack will trigger an entire page reload, which means that we lose
the component's state. We can solve this with hot module replacement.

## Enabling Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Explaining how hot module replacement or HMR works, is worth an entire post in
itself. If you're interested in learning more, check out the answer to [What
exactly is Hot Module Replacement in Webpack][2] on Stackoverflow.

To enable it for us, we need to turn on hot reloading within Webpack itself, and
add the appropriate React tools to compile the modules with HMR support.

```shell
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-transform
npm install --save-dev react-transform-hmr
```

These are the Babel plugins that allow HMR to be applied to React components.
Because these are just plugins for Babel, we don't have to do anything other
than enable them in our build pipeline. Create a `.babelrc` file in the project
root and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "plugins": [
        "react-transform"
      ],
      "extra": {
        "react-transform": {
          "transforms": [{
            "transform": "react-transform-hmr",
            "imports": ["react"],
            "locals": ["module"]
          }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and edit our `start` script in `package.json` to enable the hot option:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --progress --inline --hot",
  }
}
```

And now everything should be working as we anticipated!
