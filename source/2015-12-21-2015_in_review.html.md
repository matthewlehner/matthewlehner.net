> ## OneFeather

OneFeather is an online voting (and communications) platform for Canadian First
Nations. I finished the voting portion of it towards the end of 2014, and its
first election finished on January 15th. **This was Canada's first electronic
election for a First Nation.**

Canadian First Nations often do not achieve quorum in elections (not enough
people show up to vote or mail in their ballots). This is a costly problem which
most nations attempt to solve by doing heeavy advertising and promotion of the
election, or running it again at a later date.

OneFeather solves this problem and offers the same level of identity
verification as is achieved by mail in ballots. In three of the four elections
run on OneFeather, we saw more than 50% of eligible voters using OneFeather as
their preferred way to vote.

### Failed Search for Funding

In February, we decided to search for funding to support further development and
marketing of the voting platform – this search failed because:

* There's no upside to running a successful election (it doesn't increase
  credibility)
* A single corrupted election would ruin OneFeather's credibility and potential
  to run any further elections.

### OneFeather in 2016

Due to circumstances beyond my control, the non-technical side of things has
slowed down, so we may pull the plug on OneFeather's future development.

## Consulting

The consulting side of my business has done better this year than ever before,
primarily because of a budgetary increase from my anchor client. In years past,
they have had a minimal budget, but this year marked a change from being a
maintenance style contract to being a long term contract with active development.

This is bad, because if this client goes away, so does my cashflow, but good
because it's a great team of very talented developers, with an exciting roadmap
for the next 8 months.

### Training

I ran one Ember.js workshop this year – it was great, and helped the team
immensely with their product

### Speaking

No speaking this year. 😕
Hopefully next year I'll get back on the wagon.

## Technology

This has been a year of learning a functional programming paradigm. Buzzwords
include Elixir, React, Redux. I find myself increasingly finding myself wanting
similar tools in Ruby and increasingly prefering to write ES2015 flavoured
JavaScript rather than Ruby. It's a bit bittersweet to be having these feelings
about my first language, but here's why:

### Application State
Managing state is hard, and it's hard to reason about. I'm not sure that this is
a benefit of functional programming, specifically, but it forces you to think
about state specifically. The OO paradigm tells you to keep state in its
associated object, but as a system grows and becomes more complex, state is
spread out further.

With Elixir (specifically Phoenix), and Redux, you are forced to think about
state because the lack of objects/instances of these objects means there's no
"easy" place to store it, instead it must be specifically addressed. Redux
forces you to keep all state in a single JavaScript object, and Elixir/OTP
provides an excellent paradigm for managing state easily, even in complex
applications.

### Technology Choices in 2016

The nice list:

* 👍 Elixir
* 👍 React
* 👍 Redux
* 👍 npm
* 👍 Babel/ES2015

The naughty list:

* 👎 Bower
* 👎 Ember.js
* 👎 ActionCable

## General 2016 Hopes and Dreams

I've been working on a screencast series for doing TDD with webpack, React, and
Redux. We'll see where this goes!
