Speaker: <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/">Nathan Barry</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/nathanbarry">@nathanbarry</a>)

Launched 5 products in the last 9 months ~ $200,000 revenue.
<h2>Story 1: Teach everything I know</h2>
Nathan began learning learning design and development at the same time and pace as <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> from <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>. In 2012 Chris had a successful Kickstarter campaign for $89,607, Nathan had client work. What was different?

Chris taught. Nathan worked quietly.

So, he decided to teach everything he knows.
<h2>Story 2: How I made $119,000 in the app store while learning to code.</h2>
Was blogging with no lasting results to traffic - well timed hacker news posts would spike traffic, but wouldn’t result in continued growth.

To remedy, Nathan started an email list. The benefits of this are that the growth could be charted as it’s predictable and keeps you in touch with your audience.
<h2>Story 3: Lessons in Self Publishing from Chris Guillebeau</h2>
“By the way, multiple packages have worked well for me.” Chris Guillebeau

Tier1: $39 - Book

* 48% of total sales
* 16% of total revenue

Tier 2: $79 - Book and Photoshop Files

* 26% of sales
* 24% of total revenue

Tier 3: $169 - Book, Photoshop Files and Code Samples

* 26% of sales
* 60% of total revenue

Lesson - what would have been $9,000 turns into $19,547. 60% of this revenue comes from the top tier.
<h2> Story 4 - Fail to launch</h2>
Created a "Designing Web Applications" workshop. Launch strategy included a single email to his list which got him zero sales.

Relaunched with a strategy to educated the email list about the workshop, build excitement and give all of the details beforehand so that on launch day the customer will just buy the product.
<h2>Summary</h2>
<em>“Teach everything you know while using a system to stay in touch, selling packages with a well timed launch sequence.”</em>
<h2>Questions</h2>

* Deliver 10x the value as the product you are selling
Price anchoring:<em> "Where's the best place to sell a $2,000 watch? Next to a $12,000 watch"</em>
* Work consistently - 1000 words/day = a book a month
* eBooks should be short, not a lot of fluff
