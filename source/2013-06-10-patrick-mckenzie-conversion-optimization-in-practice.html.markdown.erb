If you have no product A/B testing is useless instead, talk to customers and build one copy of your site at a time until you get to 3,000 visitors per month.

Fundamental SaaS equation: sum of [traffic * conversion-rate * (ARPU/churn)]
<em>ARPU = Average revenue per user</em>

Steps through signup funnel (each of these can be viewed as a mini funnel and optimized)

 * Pre-signup
 * sign up trial
 * get usage (user enters data - this can be a ‘welcome guide’)
 * get engagement (user invites team and they use app)

<h3>Pre-Signup Funnel</h3>

* Identify high value targets
* Adding statistical numbers improve trust and not rounded numbers are better (46% is better than 40% or 50%)
* Credibly promise that you will increase their revenue and decrease their costs
* Buttons should look like buttons - they should be big and easy to click. (use the watermarking trick - can you identify the button easily?)
* Button Copywriting basic structure: Verb + benefit + some mention of immediacy (ie. ‘Get started now’, ‘Start tracking your time now’, ‘Try Freckle for free’)

<h3>Sign up for a trial</h3>

* avoid ‘Sign Up’ as button text. It fails to convey value - ‘start with this plan’ is a good alternative
* only ask for password once.
* Plans and pricing do not make sales.
* Features do not sell software
* Benefits sell software.

<h3>Onboarding Process</h3>

* Establish teacher/student roles during the onboarding process and use this as a place to teach about the benefits to their business. This mindset will make the user trust the product more.
* Throughout the process, continually be conveying value.

<h2>Quick tips and recommendations!</h2>

* Increased prices = less crazy customers
* Engagement is the ultimate driver of lower churn rates
