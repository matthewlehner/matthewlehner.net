<h2>Employment</h2>
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">honesty</span> - with your employer, business partner, life partner about what you are doing (if bootstrapping a business while working full time)
  * Define a specific point where you will go full time on your own product (quit working for others) "10,000 customers or $30k/month recurring revenue"

<h2>Product</h2>
 * Focus on solving a problem in the simplest way for your customers
 * Solution + Payment System = product
 * Don't write software for admin stuff
 * Do not complicate the product.
