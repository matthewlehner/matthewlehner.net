<em>“Every sale has five basic obstacles -</em>
<em>no need</em>
<em> no money</em>
<em> no hurry</em>
<em> no desire</em>
<em> no trust”</em>
- Zig Ziglar

<h3>Objection - No money</h3>

* Anchor to the other price.
* Only show features related to price in all other cases highlight benefits.

<h3>Objection - No hurry</h3>

* Introduce urgency by limiting spots and selling out
* eBook - limited time discounts

<h3>Objection - No trust</h3>

* Gain trust with testimonials - these can be for other work (just make sure you state that)
* Add money-back guarantee
* Send sample of product
