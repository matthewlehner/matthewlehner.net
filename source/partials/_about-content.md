I'm Matthew Lehner. I build software and help amazing people bring their projects into existence.

For the past five years, I’ve run a single person consultancy and have worked with a wide range of clients from Scripps Health (in the San Diego area), the City of Vancouver, and OneFeather (Canada’s first online voting platform for First Nations).

On the technical side of things, I’m a full stack developer with devops skills and have a great track record of delivering high quality work on time and within budget. My current passion is bringing great engineering practices to the front end to build user interfaces that are a joy for users to interact with as well as rock solid and reliable.

My approach to projects brings a pragmatic balance of meeting deadlines and high quality engineering. i.e. – I understand business objectives, ship on time, and ensure that corners aren’t cut in the process. This balance is important because it means that a project’s momentum can continue even as its requirements shift and solidify throughout its lifetime.
